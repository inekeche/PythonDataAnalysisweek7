📊 Iris Sales Data Analysis and Visualization
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and data visualization using the popular Python libraries pandas and matplotlib. It works with an extended version of the Iris dataset (Irissales.csv), possibly containing both flower measurements and time-series sales data.

📁 Dataset
File: Irissales.csv
Expected Columns:

sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, species (standard Iris dataset)

date, sales (for time-series visualization)

Ensure your Irissales.csv is in the same directory as your Python script.

🔧 Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

Install required libraries with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib
🚀 How to Run
Place the Irissales.csv file in the same folder as your script.

Run the Python file in any IDE (like PyCharm, VS Code) or terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
python iris_analysis.py
📈 What This Project Does
✅ Data Loading and Exploration
Loads CSV using pandas

Displays first 5 rows

Checks data types and missing values

✅ Descriptive Statistics
Computes .describe() summary of numerical data

Groups by species to compute mean values

Finds species with highest average petal length

Calculates standard deviation of sepal_width by species

✅ Data Visualization Using matplotlib
1. Line Chart
Plots sales over date to visualize trends (if available)

2. Bar Chart
Average petal length per species

3. Histogram
Distribution of sepal_length

4. Scatter Plot
Relationship between sepal_length and petal_length

🖼 Sample Visuals
(Add images here if running in Jupyter or exporting charts)

🧠 Insights You Can Derive
Which Iris species has the longest average petals

Patterns in sepal-petal dimensions

Sales trends over time (if sales and date columns exist)

Feature distributions and inter-relationships

📌 Notes
You can extend this project by adding seaborn, plotly, or saving plots to files using plt.savefig().

If your dataset lacks date or sales columns, remove or modify the line chart section accordingly.
